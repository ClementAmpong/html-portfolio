<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Nana; a data analyst and a web developer with a passion for building smart and practical solutions. 
  I work at the intersection of data, technology, and real-world impact. 
  From designing machine learning models to developing clean, insightful dashboards, I enjoy turning raw data into something people can actually use. </p>

  <p>I believe good data solves problems, tells stories, and helps people make better decisions; and 
    that’s what I aim to do every day.</p>
